Instagram Challenge
===================

## What is this?

This is a replica of instagram built with ruby-on-rails.

## User Stories
```
As a user
So I can impress my friends with my aesthetic
I want to be able to upload a picture

As a user
So that I can judge other people secretly
I want to be able to see a list of all the pictures that others have uploaded

As a user
So that I can judge people people openly
I want to be able to comment on a picture

As a user
So that I can convey my tastes more quickly
I'd like to be able to like a picture

As a user
So that I can access all the functionality
I'd like to be able to make an account

As a user
So I can protect my posts from being toyed with by other malicious users
I'd like the edit and delete options for my posts to be removed if the current user isn't me

```

### Instructions
